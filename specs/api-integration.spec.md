# API Integration Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the API integration strategy for the Zonos Commerce project, focusing on the integration with Zonos Elements Serverless APIs and any additional APIs required for the e-commerce functionality, following the patterns established in Next.js Commerce.

## API Endpoints

The following Zonos Elements API endpoints will be integrated:

### Zonos Elements API (TBD)

| Endpoint | Description | Method |
|----------|-------------|--------|


## Authentication

All Zonos Elements API requests will be authenticated using the CUSTOMER_GRAPH_TOKEN, which can be retrieved from the Zonos Dashboard.

The `CUSTOMER_GRAPH_TOKEN` is a secret API token that must never be exposed client-side and must only be used in server-side operations. This token provides secure access to the Zonos Graph API and is used for all server-side API calls.

For the upcoming Zonos Checkout integration, a separate public API key (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ZONOS_API_KEY`) will be used. This organization key is designed for client-side usage and allows verification of organization access to the graph and checking for allowed domains in the Zonos Elements API. Unlike the `CUSTOMER_GRAPH_TOKEN`, this key can safely be included in client-side code.

## Type Definitions (TBD)

The integration will define TypeScript interfaces for all key data structures.

## Server Actions (TBD)

Following Next.js Commerce patterns, we'll use Server Actions for data mutations:

These actions will use the Zonos client library for API communication and will handle cache invalidation through revalidatePath.

## Data Fetching in React Server Components

Next.js Commerce takes advantage of React Server Components for data fetching:

- Product pages will use server components to fetch product data
- Metadata generation will use product information for SEO optimizations
- Related products will be fetched based on category
- Edge runtime will be utilized where appropriate for improved performance

## API Routes (TBD)

For client-side API access and webhooks, we'll implement Next.js API routes:

These routes will validate inputs, handle errors appropriately, and return properly structured responses.

## Cache Invalidation

Following Next.js Commerce patterns, we'll implement comprehensive cache revalidation strategies:

- **Dedicated API route** for controlled cache invalidation
  - Authenticated using a secret key
  - Support for invalidating specific tags
  - Integration with webhooks for automatic invalidation

- **Tag-based invalidation** using `revalidateTag`
  - Define clear cache tags for different data types (products, collections, cart)
  - Selectively invalidate data by tag when backend changes occur

- **Path-based invalidation** using `revalidatePath`
  - Automatically invalidate affected routes after mutations
  - Server actions (like `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`) will handle appropriate path invalidation

- **Caching mechanisms**
  - Server Components caching for expensive data fetching operations
  - Route handlers with cache options
  - Data fetching operations with appropriate cache settings

- **Automatic invalidation triggers**
  - After mutations via server actions
  - Through webhooks when external data changes
  - On-demand through API routes for manual control

These approaches ensure data remains fresh while maximizing performance benefits of caching.

## Error Handling

The API integration will implement robust error handling:

- Custom error classes for different error types
- Consistent error handling patterns across all operations
- Proper error propagation and logging
- User-friendly error messages

## Testing Strategy

The API integration will be tested comprehensively:

### Unit Testing

- Individual operation functions will be tested in isolation
- Mocking of fetch calls to simulate API responses
- Testing of success and error scenarios
- Verification of proper error handling
